<h3> Long-term forest bird monitoring program </h3>

<p> The Northeast Temperate Network's (NETN) breeding bird monitoring program has been implemented since 2006 in partnership with the <a href="https://vtecostudies.org/">Vermont Center of Ecostudies</a> and many volunteer birders. The program was established to determine status and trends in species composition of breeding landbirds in the park. </p>

<p>This report summarizes park-level forest bird monitoring results between `r minYear` and `r maxYear` in `r Park` for the following topics:</p>
<ul>
 <li> <b>[Bird Diversity]:</b> Summary of the number of species detected since `r minYear` and across monitoring sites.</li> 
 <li> <b>[Bird Community Index]:</b> Summary of the condition of the park's forest bird community.</li> 
 <li> <b>[Species trends]:</b> Summary of bird abundance over time for a variety of selected species. </li> 
 <li> <b>[Conclusions]</b> </li> 
 <li> <b>[Supporting Resources]:</b> List of references and associated documentation for the bird monitoring program.</li> 
 </ul>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p> The analysis in this report is based on repeated visits to  permanent monitoring sites shown in the map to the right. Each point is typically visited once a year but occasionally twice, during the late spring to mid-summer during peak breeding. At each visit all birds heard or seen during a 10-minute period are recorded. Additionally, the observers indicate an approximate distance to the bird, for example, within 10 meters (~33 feet) or further. For detailed information on the methods and analysis, please consult the [Supporting Resources]. </p>

<p> If you have questions about this program, report, or would like to acquire data or speak about bird monitoring in your park please contact NETN staff  <a href="mailto:ed_sharron@nps.gov"> Ed Sharron (Bird Volunteer Coordinator)</a>,  <a href="mailto:adam_kozlowksi@nps.gov"> Adam Kozlowski (Data Manager)</a>, or <a href="mailto: aaron_weed@nps.gov"> Aaron Weed (Program Manager)</a>.</p>

### Bird Diversity {.tabset}

<p>  The number of detected species (or species richness) is a key metric from our monitoring because it provides a straight-forward indication of the birds that are likely using `r Park` as breeding habitat during the summer. The number of species may change over time due to many factors affecting the local area surrounding the park's forest (e.g., weather, forest cover, understory vegetation) or factors affecting bird populations at greater geographic scales, such as regional forest health and wintering habitat survival. </p> 

#### No. of Species over time

<p> The graph below shows the number of bird species detected during monitoring each year (blue) and the number of species estimated after accounting for imperfect detection (green, see Doser et al. 2020). Note that this plot is not showing the total number of bird species in the park, as other species may be present but not detected during monitoring.</p>

<p> <b>There are two main take-home messages related to bird diversity from our monitoring thus far: </b> </p> 
<ul>
<li> The number of species has remained <b> unchanged </b> between `r minYear` to `r maxYear` in `r Park`. A total of 
`r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == Park])` species has been detected with an average of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == Park], byYear = TRUE) %>% dplyr::pull(Richness) %>% mean() %>% round(0)` species detected per year. It is important to note that the number of species <i>estimated</i> as shown in the graph (green) is typically higher than the number actually detected during monitoring (blue) because not all birds may have been detected during the survey due to imperfect detection (e.g., bird is present but not heard). </li> 

<li> The graph below shows trends in <i>estimated</i> species richness among all `r network` parks. While the number of forest bird species in `r Park` has not changed, it is one of 4 `r network` parks showing a slight (but non-significant) decline in estimated species richness over time. Species richness at `r Park` ranks in as #7 among the 11 eleven `r network` parks monitored. </li>
</ul>

#### No. of Species among sites

<div style="float:right;position:relative;top:10px;padding:5px 5px 5px 10px;margin:0px 5px 10px 5px">
```{r richmap, echo = FALSE,  fig.height=6, fig.width= 6, fig.align = 'left', warning= FALSE, comment=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap= "Map of Species Richness at permanent sites"}
mapRichness(BirdData[ParkList == Park], title = "No. of species", palette = "viridis", band = 1:2)
```
</div>

This map shows the cumulative total number of species observed during field surveys at each site since `r minYear`.

<p> While no formal analysis has been completed, this map suggests that more species have been detected in the western area of the park, specifically along the Soldier's Huts Route. </p>

### Bird Community Index {.tabset}

<p> The Bird Community Index (BCI- O'Connell et al. 1998, 2000) is an index designed to indicate the conservation status of the bird community in forested areas such as those in `r network` parks. It was developed for conservation of forest birds common within the Central Appalachian region but our analyses indicate that it is also applicable to and helpful for characterizing breeding birds in `r network` parks because of the similarity of species. To calculate the BCI, the list of birds from each site is considered separately. If a site has many bird species that are typically restricted to intact forest areas (&quot;forest obligates&quot;) the site gets a high score, whereas birds that live in a variety of areas (&quot;generalists&quot;) give a site a low score.</p>

<p> Many factors are used to assess the
degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These
include: </p>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>
 <li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>
 <li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>
 <li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, omnivore,etc)? </li>
 <li>Is the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>
 <li>Is the species exotic?</li>
 <li>Is the species a park resident year-round or does it migrate?</li>
 <li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Based on these assessments each point is assigned a score. The scores are then averaged for the entire park in each year.
This average score is used to categorize the bird community of the park as either Low, Medium, High or Highest Integrity. </p>

#### BCI over time

The graph below shows that the BCI rating at `r Park` has remained relatively unchanged since `r minYear` and is considered to be of "High Integrity' compared to other bird communities within the Central Appalachian region. 

<div style="float:right;position:relative;top:10px;padding:1px 1px 1px 1px;margin:0px 5px 10px 5px">
```{r BCI, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width= 8, fig.align = 'center', message=FALSE}
NCRNbirds::BCIPlot(BirdData[ParkList == Park], type= "Cent_Appal",  plot_title = "Average annual Bird Community Index across park", band = 1:2, caption = FALSE)

```
Data above are summarized from field observations within 100 meters of the observer. The points on the graph denote the BCI rating for points monitored during 2019. The horizontal axis indicates the year, with the number of points monitored by visit in parenthesis. 
</div>

#### BCI across park
Bird Community Index ratings for permanent monitoring sites in `r year` showing variation in BCI across `r Park`. Similar to species richness, BCI is highest in the western portion of the park on our Soldier's Huts route.

```{r BCIrichmap, echo = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width= 10, fig.align = 'center', message=FALSE}
mapBCI(BirdData[ParkList == Park], band =2, type= "Cent_Appal", years = 2019)
```

Data in the map are summarized from field observations within 100 meters of the observer. The points on the map denote the BCI rating for sites monitored during `r year`. Clicking on the site displays the unique site name and the BCI rating.


#### BCI compared to other parks

As of `r maxYear`, `r Park` has the 4th highest BCI rating in `r network`.  

```{r, BCIPark, echo=F, fig.height=4, fig.width= 8, fig.align = 'center'}

BCIPark<- map(BirdData, ~BCI(.x))

parkdata<-BCIPark %>% map("BCI")%>% map_dbl(mean) %>% round(1)

      labs(x="", y="Average BCI score")+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title= "Average BCI score per park since monitoring began")


ggplotly(GraphOut)
```
<p>
<p>
<p>
The analysis by Doser et al. (2020)  concluded that the BCI rating varies per park and that trends in overall bird abundance are declining the fastest in parks with the highest BCI rating as depicted below. 

```{r, BCITrend, echo=F, fig.cap="Relationship between the estimated slope in bird abundance over time for each park and the average BCI at each park. (Doser et al. 2020). Vertical lines represent the 95% CI for the slope and horizontal lines represent the 95% CI for the BCI. Inset text is the estimated Pearson’s correlation coefficient (with 95% CI)."}

To the right are the plotted trend estimates for top 10 most abundant species in the park from Doser et al. (2020). Populations in the park are stable when the trend estimate error bars, or credible intervals (C.I.), do not overlap zero (e.g. Eastern Wood-Pewee). The rank order of abundance in the park is denoted in parentheses following the species name. None of the most abundant species are increasing over time in the `r Park` but 6 of 10 species have stable populations. Scarlet Tanager, American Robin, Blue Jay, and Tufted Titmouse detections declined significantly during the monitoring period from `r minYear ` - `r maxYear `.

#### Species plots

Below are the average annual counts and significant trends of the top 10 most abundant species detected since `r minYear` across the park over time. Plots show the average annual abundance of bird observations within 100 meters of the observer among sites. During years when a site was surveyed more than once, the plotted average is calculated from the maximum count per survey visit in a year. The estimate of the trend (95% C.I.) is denoted in the upper right of each panel. If the interval does  not contain zero the trend is statistically significant over time (e.g., Blue Jay).
