NETN monitoring has determined that the forest resources at `r params$Park` provide critically important breeding habitat for a diversity of songbirds indicating that stewardship practices that maintain a healthy and diverse forest creates the best potential for a thriving bird community. One of the most important findings from our recent analysis is that bird abundance increases with the amount of forest area surrounding it (Figure 11B). Despite the intricate and diverse breeding requirements of the `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` species detected during monitoring at `r params$Park`, their average abundance is positively influenced by the presence of forest cover (Doser et al. 2021).

The Bird Community Index scores suggest that the forest bird community at `r params$Park` is very healthy within the network, ranking 3rd among the parks analyzed and scoring consistently as <ins>Highest Integrity</ins> as compared to the broader ecoregion. This is a great sign and means that the bird community at `r params$Park` is diverse and comprised of many forest specialist species. No non-native species have been detected since monitoring began at `r params$Park` suggesting that issues such as brood parasitism commonly due to exotic species is not an issue. The trend analysis suggests that the overall number of songbirds breeding in the park has remained the same since monitoring began but it indicated a significant decline of Ovenbird in the park. Declines in Ovenbird, which has been the 2nd most commonly detected species at `r params$Park`, is concerning but requires further inquiry. According to the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) results, Ovenbird has been declining across BBS routes in NH during the same time period, but the population trend is steady when examined from 1966 to 2019 (Sauer et al. 2019). Overall, the trend results indicate that `r params$Park` has diverse and stable breeding populations of resident and migratory songbirds, some of which are regionally important conservation species. 

While the results presented here suggest that `r params$Park` has provided breeding habitat to a diversity of species that is comparable to other healthy forests in the region, there some concerns regarding the state and direction of forest health at `r params$Park` that have direct bearing on the future habitat for these species at the park. `r params$Park`'s forest is dominated by Eastern Hemlock and naturally has a low level of regeneration and diversity in it's understory (Miller and Seirup 2018). American Beech and Both stressors will likely affect the songbird community over time because forest regeneration not only replaces future forest cover, but also creates structure in the understory and mid-story, which is important for breeding songbird nesting and foraging. Management activities that maintain forest cover, a healthy forest understory layer, and a diverse age structure will provide many benefits to the forest birds breeding at `r params$Park`. Actions to address species-specific trends at `r params$Park` will need further evaluation and consideration of all factors affecting their ecology, which may extend beyond the park (e.g., survival during migration, regional forest fragmentation).
