During our monitoring we have detected a total of 65 species since `r params$minYear` and about 30 species appear to be breeding annually across the sites monitored. Many of the species detected require un-fragmented, healthy forests for breeding. Eleven species we have detected are of regional conservation concern and of these, 4 are within the top 20 most commonly encountered species at the park (Veery, Eastern Wood-Peewee, Wood Thrush, and Scarlet Tanager). 

NETN monitoring has determined that the forest resources at `r params$Park` provide critically important breeding habitat for a diversity of songbirds indicating that stewardship practices that maintain a healthy and diverse forest creates the best potential for a thriving bird community. One of the most important findings from our recent analysis is that bird abundance across the network increases with the amount of forest area surrounding it (Figure 11b). While the results shown in Figure 11b may suggest a subtle decline in abundance across a narrow range forest cover that is monitored at SAGA, the overall community of breeding birds at the park is healthy in comparison to other forests in the region and is inhabited by species typical of mixed forests with mature structure.

The Bird Community Index scores suggest that the forest bird community at `r params$Park` is very healthy within the network, ranking 3rd among the parks analyzed and scoring consistently as <ins>High Integrity</ins> as compared to the broader ecoregion. This is a great sign and means that the bird community at `r params$Park` is diverse and comprised of many forest specialist species. No non-native species have been detected since monitoring began at `r params$Park`. The trend analysis suggests that the overall number of songbirds breeding in the park has remained the same since monitoring began but it indicated a significant decline of Ovenbird in the park. Declines in Ovenbird, which has been the 2nd most commonly detected species at `r params$Park`, is concerning but requires further inquiry. According to the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) results, Ovenbird has been declining across BBS routes in NH during the same time period, but the population trend is steady when examined from 1966 to 2019 (Sauer et al. 2019). Overall, the trend results indicate that `r params$Park` has diverse and stable breeding populations of resident and migratory songbirds, some of which are regionally important conservation species. 

While the results presented here suggest that `r params$Park` provides breeding habitat to a diversity of species that is comparable to other healthy forests in the region, there some concerns regarding the state and direction of forest health at `r params$Park` that have direct bearing on the future habitat for these species at the park. `r params$Park`'s forest is dominated by Eastern Hemlock and naturally has a low level of regeneration and diversity in its understory (Miller and Seirup 2018). The invasive insect Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA) is only miles away from SAGA so monitoring HWA arrival, spread, and impact on the forest community will be imperative to understanding how quickly this insect may change the forest composition. The presence of invasive shrubs is also concerning. Early management of invasive shrubs, particularly in vulnerable hemlock stands, is essential to prevent the expansion of invasive shrub thickets from establishing. Changes in SAGA's forest that may occur due to hemlock mortality by HWA or the expansion of invasive shrubs will affect the songbird community over time because changes in the forest understory, mid-story and canopy affect songbird breeding.  Management activities that maintain forest cover, a healthy forest understory layer, and a diverse age structure of trees will provide many benefits to the forest birds breeding at `r params$Park`.
