We have detected a total of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` species at `params$Park` since `r params$minYear`. Of these it appears that ~20-30 species are breeding annually across the sites monitored. Nine of the species we have detected are of regional conservation concern and of these, Scarlet Tanager is within the top 20 most commonly encountered species at the park.

The forest resources at `r params$Park` provide critically important breeding habitat for a diversity of songbirds indicating that stewardship practices that maintain a healthy and diverse forest creates the best potential for a thriving bird community. One of the most important findings from our recent analysis is that bird abundance increases with the amount of forest area surrounding it (Figure 11B). Despite the intricate and diverse breeding requirements of the `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` species detected during monitoring at `r params$Park`, their average abundance is positively influenced by the presence of forest cover (Doser et al. 2021).

The Bird Community Index scores suggest that the diversity of the forest bird community at `r params$Park` is lower and consists of fewer forest specialist species than compared to healthy forests within the region, ranking 9th among the 10 parks analyzed and scoring consistently as <ins>Low to Medium Integrity</ins>. The BCI results are not surprising given the list of regionally, common "generalist" species that are detected and the surrounding land-cover which consists of small, fragmented, forest parcels distributed among many residential properties. However, what is surprising is that despite the declining trends forest health at the park due to chronic deer browse and invasive plants (Miller and Seirup 2017; Miller et al. 2021), most of the birds are increasing in abundance over time or are stable, which is also what we are finding in the BBS data. Our monitoring has made it is clear that a large diversity of birds, some of which are of conservation importance,  still breed annually in `r params$Park` and deserve protection. Protection of areas within the park that provide breeding habitat for the forest specialists, such as areas of contiguous, un-fragmented forest is critical. 

While the results presented here suggest that `r params$Park` has provided breeding habitat to a diversity of species, there are a number of concerns regarding the state and direction of forest health at `r params$Park` that have direct bearing on the future habitat for these birds at the park. Invasive plants have increased over time (Miller et al. 2020) and high deer browse has limited natural levels of forest regeneration (Miller and Seirup 2017). Both stressors will likely affect the songbird community over time because forest regeneration not only replaces future forest cover, but also creates structure in the understory and mid-story, which is important for breeding songbird nesting and foraging. Management activities that maintain forest cover, a healthy forest understory layer, and a diverse mix of vegetation size and age classes will provide many benefits to the forest birds breeding at `r params$Park`.

Impacts from deer overabundance, including reduced tree regeneration and understory diversity, are 
widespread throughout ROVA sites, and are most severe in HOFR and sections of VAMA. Deer 
management may be necessary to ensure sufficient regeneration and maintain understory native 
diversity. While invasive plant species are present in the majority of forest plots, they do not appear 
to be increasing in abundance since monitoring began in 2007. Managing deer densities where 
impacts are most severe (e.g. HOFR, parts of VAMA) will help ensure invasives remain at relatively 
low levels, as
