The community of breeding birds monitored at `r params$Park` is the most diverse among network parks due to the combination of sites surveyed in forested and grassland/open field habitats. During our monitoring we have detected a mix of generalist species, a couple of exotic species, and a variety of native species which require forests and grasslands for breeding. While we have detected about 100 species since `r params$minYear`, 50-60 species appear to be breeding annually across the forested and grassland sites monitored. Twenty of these species are of regional conservation concern and of these, 5 are within the top 20 most commonly encountered species at the park.

Because the network-level trend analysis utilized NETN's forest vegetation monitoring data to evaluate effects of forest structure on the bird community we have not yet examined trends of the grassland breeding species. A grassland-specific analysis of the bird community is forthcoming. One of the most important findings from the forest bird analysis was that across the network and at `r params$Park`, bird abundance at each site increases with the amount of forest area surrounding it (Figure 11b; Doser et al. 2021). Forest resources at `r params$Park` provide critically important breeding habitat for a diversity of landbirds and, in particular, for a variety of species of regional conservation importance, indicating that stewardship practices that maintain a healthy and diverse forest creates the best potential for a thriving bird community. Maintaining forest cover of native tree species and a healthy understory of native species is the best way the park can encourage bird nesting. We plan to complete similar analyses for the grassland species. Until then our preliminary evaluation of a few grassland obligate species suggests that populations of Bobolink, Eastern Meadowlark, and Savannah Sparrow appear to be stable in the park but are declining regionally.

The Bird Community Index, which summarizes the forest bird community to assess forest condition, suggested that the diversity of forest birds at `r params$Park` is on average lower and consists of fewer forest specialist species than compared to healthy forests within the region, ranking 8th among NETN parks analyzed and scoring consistently as <ins>Medium Integrity</ins>. This is not surprising given the trends in forest health at the park, history of land-use at the park, and presence of generalist and exotic species detected. Regional declines, as indicated by the BBS data, suggest that many of the common and forest specialist species we are detecting at `r params$Park` are also in decline regionally so factors outside of the park may also be responsible. However, it is clear that a large diversity of species, some of which are of conservation importance, are still breeding consistently in `r params$Park` and the relative abundances of many are increasing over time despite the opposite occurring at the state- and BCR-scale.  

The results from NETN's monitoring suggest that while many resident and migratory birds breed at `r params$Park`, our forest monitoring highlights a few important concerns regarding the overall state and direction of forest health that have direct bearing on the future habitat for birds and other species at the park. `r params$Park`'s forest understory is composed of many non-native species (Miller et al. 2021) and regeneration of native forest canopy species is moderate to low (Miller and Seirup 2018). Of particular concern is the combination of high abundance of invasive shrubs and a lack of native tree regeneration in the understory -- two factors that not only threaten the future of forest cover in the park, but also the ability of the forest to support breeding birds. Efforts to reduce current infestations and limit spread of invasive plants into the less invaded areas is one step to help ensure continual native forest canopy in `r params$Park`. Deer management may also be needed to encourage a stronger regeneration layer, which over time will provide critical habitat for certain nesting and foraging birds. Management activities that maintain forest cover, a healthy forest understory layer, and a diverse age structure of trees will provide many benefits to the forest birds breeding at `r params$Park`.
