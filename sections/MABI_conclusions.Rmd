The community of breeding birds monitored at `r params$Park` is one of the most diverse among network parks consisting of a variety of native species which require forests for breeding. While we have detected 66 species since `r params$minYear`, ~40 species appear to be breeding annually across the sites monitored and some of our detections are of species breeding within the open fields surrounding our sites (e.g., Bobolink). Sixteen of these species are of regional conservation concern and of these, 5 are within the top 20 most commonly encountered species at the park. This monitoring has determined that the forest resources at `r params$Park` provide critically important breeding habitat for a diversity of songbirds indicating that stewardship practices that maintain a healthy and diverse forest creates the best potential for a thriving bird community. One of the most important findings from our recent analysis is that bird abundance increases with the amount of forest area surrounding it (Figure 11B). Despite the intricate and diverse breeding requirements of the species detected during monitoring at `r params$Park`, their average abundance is positively influenced by the presence of forest cover (Doser et al. 2021).

The Bird Community Index scores suggest that the forest bird community at `r params$Park` is healthy within the network, ranking 2nd among the parks analyzed and scoring consistently as <ins>High Integrity</ins> as compared to the broader Appalachian ecoregion. This is a great sign and means that the bird community at `r params$Park` is diverse and comprised of many forest specialist species, and no non-native species. However, the trend analysis suggested that the overall number of songbirds breeding in the park has declined since monitoring began and this pattern seems to be driven by declines of many common species such as Ovenbird, Red eyed-Vireo, American Robin, Black-capped Chickadee, and Hermit Thrush, some of which also appear to be in decline at broader regional scales.  While it may seem like abundance and BCI should track similarly over time, BCI is based on the diversity of species and its calculation is independent of abundance. Our monitoring data suggests that while many forest specialists are still breeding in the park we have observed declines of some species of regional conservation importance such as Scarlet Tanager and Eastern Wood Pee-Wee. The declines of these species and those we have observed of Ovenbird, Red-eyed Vireo, and Hermit Thrush is concerning and requires further inquiry to examine whether and how local or regional factors may be influencing their abundance in the park.

 While we are seeing declines of some common species at the park that are not occurring in other parks or across the region, the state and direction of forest health at `r params$Park` is relatively healthy (Miller and Seirup 2018). Invasive plants are at low abundance and have declined over time (Miller et al. 2021) and although we are seeing moderate levels of deer browse in some areas of the park, overall stand condition, diversity, and structure is healthy and natural levels of forest regeneration is sufficient (Miller and Seirup 2018). Management activities that maintain native forest cover, a healthy forest understory layer, and a diverse mix of plant species and tree age classes will provide many benefits to the forest birds breeding at `r params$Park`. Actions to address species-specific trends or to evaluate effects of silvicultural treatments at `r params$Park` will need further evaluation including consideration of factors known to affect their ecology, which may extend beyond the park (e.g., survival during migration, regional forest fragmentation), and the long term objectives of the forest management plan (MABI 2006).
