NETN monitoring has determined that the forest resources at `r params$Park` provide critically important breeding habitat for a diversity of songbirds indicating that stewardship practices that maintain a healthy and diverse forest creates the best potential for a thriving bird community. One of the most important findings from our recent analysis is that bird abundance increases with the amount of forest area surrounding it (Figure 11B). Despite the intricate and diverse breeding requirements of the `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` species detected during monitoring at `r params$Park`, their average abundance is positively influenced by the presence of forest cover (Doser et al. 2021).

The Bird Community Index scores suggest that the forest bird community at `r params$Park` is relatively healthy within the network, ranking 4th among the parks analyzed and scoring consistently as <ins>High Integrity</ins> as compared to the broader Appalachian ecoregion. This is a great sign and means that the bird community at `r params$Park` is diverse and comprised of many forest specialist species, and few non-native species. However, the trend analysis suggests that the overall number of songbirds breeding in the park has declined since monitoring began and this pattern seems to be driven by declines in regionally common species such as Blue Jay, American Robin, Tufted Titmouse, and Wood Thrush, which also appear to be in decline at broader regional scales.  While it may seem like abundance and BCI should track similarly over time, BCI is based on the diversity of species and its calculation is independent of abundance. Our monitoring data suggest that while common and often more generalist species are in decline at `r params$Park`, species of regional conservation importance such as Wood Thrush, Eastern Towhee, and Eastern Wood Pee-Wee appear to be thriving at the park for now. On the other hand, the decline of Scarlet Tanager in the park is concerning and requires further inquiry as it also appears to be declining regionally.

While the results presented here suggest that `r params$Park` has provided breeding habitat to a diversity of species that is comparable to other healthy forests in the region, there are a number of concerns regarding the state and direction of forest health at `r params$Park` that have direct bearing on the future habitat for these species at the park. Invasive plants have increased over time (Miller et al. 2020) and high deer browse has limited natural levels of forest regeneration (Miller and Seirup 2017). Both stressors will likely affect the songbird community over time because forest regeneration not only replaces future forest cover, but also creates structure in the understory and mid-story, which is important for breeding songbird nesting and foraging. Management activities that maintain forest cover, a healthy forest understory layer, and a diverse mix of vegetation size and age classes will provide many benefits to the forest birds breeding at `r params$Park`. Actions to address species-specific trends at `r params$Park` will need further evaluation and consideration of all factors affecting their ecology, which may extend beyond the park (e.g., survival during migration, regional forest fragmentation).
