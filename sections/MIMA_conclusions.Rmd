NETN monitoring has determined that the community of breeding birds at `r params$Park` is as expected for a park in a relatively urban setting surrounded by fragmented forests and intensive land-use practices: breeding by a mix of cosmopolitan, exotic, and generalist species and a few forest specialists. One of the most important findings from our recent trend analysis is that bird abundance across the network and at `r params$Park` increases with the amount of forest area surrounding it (Figure 11b). Forest resources at `r params$Park` provide critically important breeding habitat for a diversity of landbirds and, in particular, for at least 14 species of regional conservation importance, indicating that stewardship practices that maintain a healthy and diverse forest creates the best potential for a thriving bird community. Maintaining forest cover of native tree species and a healthy understory of native species is the best way the park can encourage bird nesting.

The Bird Community Index scores suggest that the diversity of the forest bird community at `r params$Park` is lower and consists of fewer forest specialist species than compared to healthy forests within the region, ranking last among the parks analyzed and scoring consistently as <ins>Medium Integrity</ins>. As mentioned above this is not surprising given the trends in forest health at the park, surrounding land-use, and history of land-use at the park. Regional declines, as indicated by the BBS data, suggest that many of the common landbirds we are detecting at `r params$Park` are also in decline regionally so factors outside of the park are likely to be responsible. However, it is clear that a large diversity of species, some of which are of conservation importance, are still breeding consistently in `r params$Park` and deserve protection. Protection of areas within the park that provide breeding habitat of the forest specialists, such as areas of relatively mature and undisturbed forest, is critical. 

The results from NETN's monitoring suggest that while many resident and migratory birds breed at `r params$Park`, our forest monitoring highlights a few important concerns regarding the overall state and direction of forest health that have direct bearing on the future habitat for birds and other species at the park. `r params$Park`'s forest is composed of many non-native and old field species and regeneration of native forest canopy species is moderate to low (Miller and Seirup 2008). Of particular concern is the combination of high abundance of invasive shrubs and a lack of native tree regeneration in the understory -- two factors that not only threaten the future of forest cover in the park, but also the ability of the forest to support breeding birds. Efforts to reduce current infestations and limit spread of invasive plants into the less invaded areas is one step to help ensure continual native forest canopy in `r params$Park`. Deer management may also be needed to encourage a stronger regeneration layer, which over time will provide critical habitat for certain nesting and foraging birds. Management activities that maintain forest cover, a healthy forest understory layer, and a diverse age structure of trees will provide many benefits to the forest birds breeding at `r params$Park`.
