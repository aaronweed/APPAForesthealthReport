<h3> Long-term forest bird monitoring program </h3>

<p> The Northeast Temperate Network's (NETN) breeding bird monitoring program has been implemented since 2006 in partnership with the <a href="https://vtecostudies.org/">Vermont Center of Ecostudies</a> and many volunteer birders. The program was established to determine status and trends in species diversity and the abundance of breeding landbirds in the park. </p>

<p>This report summarizes forest bird monitoring results between `r params$minYear` and `r params$maxYear` in `r getParkNames(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], name.class = "long")` (`r params$Park`) for the following topics:</p>
<ul>
 <li> <b>Bird Diversity:</b> A summary of the number of species detected since `r params$minYear` across all monitoring sites.</li> 
 <li> <b>Bird Community Index:</b> A summary of the condition of the park's forest bird community.</li> 
 <li> <b>Species Trends:</b> A summary of bird abundance over time for the most common species. </li> 
 <li> <b>Conclusions</b>: A summary of bird monitoring results in the context of park forest health. </li>
 <li> <b>Supporting Resources:</b> List of references and associated documentation for the bird monitoring program.</li> 
 </ul>

<br>
<h3>Methods</h3>

<p> The analyses in this report are based on repeated visits to  permanent monitoring sites shown in the map to the right. Each point is typically visited once a year but occasionally twice during the peak breading season from late spring to mid summer. At each visit all birds heard or seen during a 10-minute period are recorded. Additionally, the observers indicate an approximate distance to the bird. For detailed information on the methods and analysis, please consult the Supporting Resources. </p>

<p> If you have questions about this program, report, or would like to acquire data or speak about bird monitoring in your park please contact NETN staff  <a href="mailto:ed_sharron@nps.gov"> Ed Sharron (Bird Volunteer Coordinator)</a>,  <a href="mailto:adam_kozlowksi@nps.gov"> Adam Kozlowski (Data Manager)</a>, or <a href="mailto: aaron_weed@nps.gov"> Aaron Weed (Program Manager)</a>.</p>


### Bird Diversity {.tabset}

<p>

The number of detected species (or species richness) is a key metric from our monitoring because it provides a straight-forward indication of the bird diversity using `r params$Park` as breeding habitat during the summer. The number of species may change over time due to many factors affecting the local area surrounding the park's forest (e.g., weather, forest cover, understory vegetation) or factors affecting bird populations at greater geographic scales, such as trends in regional forest structure (Holmes and Sherry 2001) and wintering habitat survival.

</p>

#### No. of Species Over Time

<p>

<b>There are three main take-home messages related to bird diversity from our monitoring thus far: </b>

</p>

<ul>

<li>

At `r params$Park`, a total of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park])` bird species has been detected between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` with an average of `r NCRNbirds::birdRichness(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], byYear = TRUE) %>% dplyr::pull(Richness) %>% mean() %>% round(0)` species detected per year (Figure 1, blue). It is likely that not all species encountered during monitoring breed within the park but the number breeding is close to the observed average species richness. Total species richness at `r params$Park` ranks as #9 among the 10 NETN parks monitored (Figure 2) but it is important to note that we also monitor grassland/open field habitats at MIMA and SARA in addition to forested sites and `r params$Park`'s forest area is the smallest in the network.

</li>

<p>

<li>

The average number of species detected each year has remained <b> unchanged </b> statistically speaking between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` in `r params$Park` (Figures 1 and 3) but the trend suggests it has increased slightly since monitoring began. The trend model (Figure 1, green) estimated more species in a couple of years (because some birds are present but weren't detected) but most field observations fall within the confidence intervals of the estimated trend (gray shading).

</li>

<p>

<li>

While the number of forest bird species in `r params$Park` has not changed over time, it is one of 4 `r params$network` parks also showing a slight (but non-significant) increase in species richness over time (Figure 3).

</li>

</ul>

<p class="caption">

Data summaries exclude species not suspected to be breeding in the forest (e.g., flyovers).  Values are missing for years when monitoring was not conducted (2007, 2008, and 2011). The number of species estimated (green) is based on the study by Doser et al. (2021), which accounts for imperfect detection and the effect of forest structure. Note that this plot is not showing the total number of bird species in the park because our methods specifically focus on forest songbirds. Other bird species may be present in the park that are not detected during monitoring."}

### Bird Community Index {.tabset}

<p> The Bird Community Index (BCI; O'Connell et al. 1998, 2000) is an index designed to indicate the conservation status (or “health”) of the bird community in forested areas such as those in `r params$network` parks. It was developed for conservation of forest birds common within the Central Appalachian region but our analyses indicate that it is also applicable to and helpful for characterizing breeding birds in `r params$network` parks because of the similarity of species. To calculate the BCI, the list of bird species from each site is considered separately. If a site has many bird species that are dependent upon intact forest areas during breeding (&quot;forest obligates&quot;) the site gets a high score, whereas birds that live in a variety of areas (&quot;generalists&quot;) give a site a low score.</p>

<p> Many factors are used to assess the
degree to which a bird species is a generalist or a forest obligate. These
include: </p>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>What habitat does the species prefer?</li>
 <li>Is the species restricted to the interior of forests?</li>
 <li>Where does the species nest (trees, shrubs, ground, etc)?</li>
 <li>What does the species eat (insects in bark, insect on the ground, omnivore, etc)? </li>
 <li>Is the species a predator or parasite of other bird's nests?</li>
 <li>Is the species exotic?</li>
 <li>Is the species a park resident year-round or does it migrate?</li>
 <li>How many broods does the species raise per year?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Based on these assessments each survey site is assigned a BCI score. The scores are then averaged for the entire park in each year.
This average score is used to categorize the bird community of the park as either Low, Medium, High, or Highest Integrity. </p>

#### BCI Over Time

Figure 4 shows that the BCI rating at `r params$Park` has remained relatively unchanged since `r params$minYear`, averaging as "Medium Integrity" compared to other bird communities within the Central Appalachian region. In some years the BCI dips into the "Low Integrity" category (2012 and 2013) and the BCI in 2009, 2015, and 2019 was more variable across sites. This variation is likely because the diversity of forest specialists detected in the park varies sightly from year to year and across the park in some years more than others.

#### BCI Across Monitoring Sites

Bird Community Index ratings for permanent monitoring sites from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear` are shown below across `r params$Park`. BCI scores range from Low (2 of 5 sites) to Medium Integrity (3 of 5 sites) compared to other forests in the Central Appalachian region.

mapBCI(BirdData[ParkList == params$Park], band =2, type= "Cent_Appal", years = params$minYear:params$maxYear, maptype = "basic")
```

#### BCI Compared to Other NETN Parks

As of `r params$maxYear`, `r params$Park` has the 9th highest BCI rating in `r params$network` (Figure 5). The trend analysis concluded that trends in overall bird abundance are declining the fastest in parks with the highest BCI rating (Doser et al. 2021) (Figure 6).

### Species Trends {.tabset}

Monitoring the status and trends of breeding birds in `r params$network` parks is a primary objective for the program. We assess population status and trends based on the abundance of each species detected over time. The tabs below illustrate the status and trends of the most common species encountered in `r params$Park`.

#### Relative Abundance

<p>

Relative abundance, expressed as the average of the maximum number of birds detected per site per year from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`, provides an indication of how often a particular species is observed during monitoring and reflects its population status in the park. Figure 7 shows that the most common species detected at `r params$Park` are a mix of species common to our region and one of regional conservation importance (Scarlet Tanager).

</p>

<p>

Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) are ecologically distinct regions in North America with similar bird communities <a href="https://www.nabci-us.org/"> (www.nabci-us.org)</a>. `r params$Park` is located within the `r params$BCRName` BCR. Within this region, species of regional conservation importance have been designated based on rankings by Partners in Flight (Panjabi et al. 2020).

<strong> Nine species of regional conservation concern within the `r params$BCRName`  BCR have been detected at `r params$Park`</strong>, including Baltimore Oriole, Black-billed Cuckoo, Eastern Kingbird, Northern Flicker, Ovenbird, Scarlet Tanager, Veery, Wood Thrush, and Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Of these, the Scarlet Tanager is among the 20 most abundant species detected (Figure 7).

Asterisks next to a species name denote species designated by Partners in Flight to be of conservation importance within the `r params$BCRName` BCR (Panjabi et al. 2020).

Figure 8. Estimated trends in abundance between 2006 to 2019 of the top 10 most common species detected at `r params$Park` from Doser et al. (2021). The rank order of abundance in the park is denoted in parentheses following the species name. Trends estimates represent the average change in abundance on the <b> log scale</b> of a species per site every <b> four years</b>. Percentage values in the plot represent the associated average percent change in abundance every 4 years for trends that are statistically significant. For example, the number of Chipping Sparrows detected has increased by about 45% every 4 years between `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`.</p>

</div>
##### <b>Top 10 Most Abundant Species at `r params$Park` </b>

<p>

Figure 8 shows the trend estimates between `r params$minYear` and `r params$maxYear` for the top 10 most abundant species in `r params$Park` based on a model using time to first detection within the 10-minute point count (Doser et al. 2021). Average population size has not changed since `r params$minYear` for species when trend estimate error bars (credible intervals, C.I.) overlap zero (8 of 10 species in Figure 8). Refer to Figure 10 in the Plots of Species Abundance section to see annual counts over time for these species.

</p>

<p>

All of the the top 10 most abundant birds detected in `r params$Park` have stable populations which appear to be increasing slightly since monitoring began in `r params$minYear`. Of these only Eastern Wood-Pewee and Chipping Sparrow have increased significantly over this time period.

Trends of the 9 species of regional conservation importance, which are not shown in Figure 8 but can be found in the section "All Species Trends", also suggest that the breeding populations of these species are stable in the park -- we continue to detect these species at our sites and the model indicated that their average abundances have not changed significantly from `r params$minYear` to `r params$maxYear`.

</p>

<p>

##### <b>Trends Across NETN Parks </b>

<p>The trend in abundance of all species combined across the network has not changed since 2006 (Figure 9A) but the trend varied widely across parks (Figure 9B). For instance, the abundance of all species combined has declined in 3 parks (ACAD, MABI, and MORR) while in SARA, ROVA, and WEFA it has increased over time. Abundance of all species detected in SAGA and MIMA remained the same during this time period.

</p>

<p>

In parks with significant decreasing or increasing trends, most species generally showed a similar trend to the overall park trend, but often only a fraction of the species-specific trends were significantly different from zero. For example, while the trend analysis indicated that 45 species are increasing at `r params$Park`, only 4 (Chipping Sparrow, Eastern Wood-Pewee, Great Crested Flycatcher, and Red-bellied Woodpecker) have increased significantly since `r params$minYear` (Figure 9C). No species that we have trend estimates for have declined significantly at WEFA. Together these results are very encouraging for the breeding bird community at WEFA.

Comparisons of NETN monitoring data at `r params$Park` to the results from the BBS routes suggest that trends in park-scale abundance are mostly consistent (6 species) with trends at the `r params$BCRName` BCR- and state-scales for the species we have trends for (8 species). While not all trends are significant, it appears that most of the common species breeding at `r params$Park` also have stable to increasing populations within the state and BCR. The only discrepancy being the significant declines BBS has recorded for American Crow and Black-capped Chickadee, which we are not observing at `r params$Park`.
